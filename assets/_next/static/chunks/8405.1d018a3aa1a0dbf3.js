The precise amount required varies among individuals, but everyone needs practice. We design a variety of mechanisms to make it fun to practice, and satisfying to progress to more challenging sets.{br}{br}Our gamification layer provides scaffolding for motivation and habit formation. This provides another tool to help learners stick with learning even in the absence of tutors or parents who help foster motivation.{br}{br}On Brilliant, the content itself is designed to feel fun — from the pedagogical design of the interactives and problem progression, to the types of sounds, feedback, and haptics we provide as you interact.{br}{br}Most of the increase in usage and learner retention has come from excellent content delivery, but gamification helps. We avoid packing too many game incentives into the product to keep the focus on the learning content, but aim to execute well on a few core habit formation loops. These include Streaks and Leagues.{br}{br}Learners progress through levels of progressively more difficult problem solving in a topic. The leveling system intentionally displays a more reductive view of concept connections and prerequisites than the underlying reality. It is focused on providing learners with clear and satisfying milestones to work toward.{br}{br}Progress is also gamified — including in how we structure XP and pass/fail feedback and routing. Currently, we’re working on testing various mechanics to extend your learning session, i.e., motivate learners to continue with the next appropriate practice, review, or lesson.{br}{br}Overall, approaches to building both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation are an area of active investigation and testing.","KzWhra":"Recipient email address","L/0Li5":"Build scientific intuition as you learn through “aha” moments, not memorizing answers.","L2annI":"Brilliant teaches how neural networks function through interactive models that demonstrate how artificial neurons connect, process inputs, and adjust weights during training, making learning accessible through interactive problems and animated examples.","L3jHrF":"Give another gift","L4x3Nk":"3-day streak","LAs+XR":"{primaryText}","LDDLGq":"Apply your learnings","LDcGVW":"What math topics should I learn for data science?","LEiSmD":"Setting a streak goal helps you stay consistent.","LF/7NE":"The recipient and sender email addresses cannot match.","LIDXd2":"privacy policy","LItO6u":"No changes to save","LIwlHh":"Reset state","LPFYYw":"A better way to learn data analysis","LTDPn/":"You have unsaved changes.","LTNDb1":"Interactive problem solving that’s effective and fun.{br}Master concepts in <bold>fractions, proportional relationships, percents</bold>, and beyond.","LTbKmb":"Discount unlocked!

The frequency, timing, and composition of practice sets are an area of active experimentation, to maximize effective retrieval and automaticity.{br}{br}In practice sets, the scaffolding falls away — you’re being tested on your independent ability to answer the questions, so there are no more visual aids or hints.{br}{br}In some courses, we’re testing (with positive results) changing problem framing. So, for example, in our introductory Statistics course the lesson asks you to find the mean of a quantity of cupcakes sold. Then the associated practice asks you to find the mean of the sale price of a drink.{br}{br}For constructing personalized practice, we predict the optimal next problem X to ask, so that you are adequately prepared to answer a future question Y. This is also a generalized testing umbrella within which we test spaced repetition (especially in weak areas), mixing practice problems from different concepts (so that the learner must identify what approach to use to solve each problem, rather than just applying the same procedure to every problem), determining level of effective automaticity (fast solving speed with no mistakes), and optimal length and difficulty per set.{br}{br}Review sets that combine problems from preceding lessons are currently being rolled out on a course-by-course basis (we human-review everything, which is why this has a gradual rollout).{br}{br}In 2026, we’ll also experiment with assessments that more closely mimic higher-stakes situations.","Uoax0R":"Existing user?","UpC7fu":"Add more seats for {price}/month each","UqAWRW":"Complete all lessons in level to start review","UsddV3":"Discount unlocked for {name}","UwNXCb":"Add a third party account","Ux6Nnz":"Phenomenal","UzyYqf":"All of our 40+ courses are crafted by award-winning teachers, researchers, and professionals from:","Uzz+CE":"What’s your top goal?","V3O3pI":"Brilliant | Learn by doing","V57fBn":"Premium benefits","V6I52f":"On Brilliant, you learn by doing—instead of watching videos or reading dense blocks of text, you learn interactively, which has been shown to be {link}.
